[INFRA-001] — Initialize monorepo with Turborepo
Date: 2026-02-20
What was done:
- Created Turborepo monorepo scaffolding at the repository root.
- Added root workspace configuration and stub package scripts for backend, web, and extension workspaces.
- Added repository baseline config files (.editorconfig and .gitignore).
- Marked INFRA-001 as passed in prd.json.
Key decisions / gotchas:
- Used minimal stub build/lint/test scripts per workspace so turbo pipelines execute before full app scaffolding.
- Kept backend as a placeholder workspace package for Turborepo orchestration; Python service setup is deferred to INFRA-003.
Files created/modified: package.json, turbo.json, .editorconfig, .gitignore, packages/backend/package.json, packages/web/package.json, packages/extension/package.json, prd.json, progress.txt

[INFRA-002] â€” Docker Compose dev environment
Date: 2026-02-20
What was done:
- Added `docker-compose.dev.yml` with MySQL 8.0, MinIO, and Redis services for local development.
- Added health checks for MySQL (`mysqladmin ping`), MinIO (`/minio/health/live`), and Redis (`redis-cli ping`).
- Added `.env.example` documenting all environment variables consumed by `docker-compose.dev.yml`.
- Marked story INFRA-002 as passed in `prd.json`.
Key decisions / gotchas:
- Added dedicated MySQL health check credentials (`MYSQL_HEALTHCHECK_USER`/`MYSQL_HEALTHCHECK_PASSWORD`) so health checks are explicit and configurable.
- Pinned MinIO image to a dated release tag for deterministic local environments.
Files created/modified: docker-compose.dev.yml, .env.example, prd.json, progress.txt
